    "## Abstract\n",
    "\n",
    "According to a 2019 FAA study, national airline delay-related costs exceeded $8 billion due to increased operating expenses.[2] Equipping airports with predictive systems for flight disruptions enables proactive mitigation strategies to absorb operational shocks and prevent cascading delays throughout the system. Therefore, our team attempted to design a machine learning classification model to predict whether an upcoming flight's departure would be disrupted or not, using information available two hours or more prior to the scheduled departure time, where \"disrupted\" flights consist of either delays over 15 minutes or cancellations.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Data was sourced from historic Department of Transportation (DoT) flight data and associated National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association (NOAA) weather station reports from the years 2015 to 2021. All results discussed in this report are with respect to a 5-year subset of the data (2015-2019, inclusive). \n",
    "\n",
    "F2 score was used to evaluate model performance, reflecting airports' priority to penalize false negatives (i.e., incorrectly predicting disrupted flights as on schedule). For the train set, F2 scores were computed within time-series cross-validation folds and averaged to summarize overall training scores. Logistic regression was chosen as the baseline model because of its suitability for a binary outcome and interpretability, achieving an F2 of .475 on train and .478 on test. Three advanced architectures were also considered and tuned to achieve their best performances: random forest (train: .475; test: .478), multilayer perceptron (train: .507; test: .525), XGBoost (train: .520; test: .535). Additionally, an ensemble was taken over their predictions and yielded an F2 score of .554 on the test set. \n",
    "\n",
    "The team focused on engineering recency- and network- related features that would inform the model of delay propagation patterns. **not sure what/how much to put here: describe what your focused on and accomplished in this project**\n",

    "### Research Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "Our primary customer is the airport management and administration; therefore, our aim is to use machine learning models to make a binary prediction of flight disruptions 2 hours prior to the scheduld flight departure time using the models described above. We define a disruption as a delay (according to the FAA definition, a flight that departs 15 minutes or more after its scheduled departure), or a cancellation. We consider flight cancellations as functionally analogous to long-term delays, similar to those reported as exceeding 24 hours. This approach is based on the idea that cancellations, like long delays, can disrupt resource allocation and operational flow. "

    "The team chose to construct a joined dataset using airports, flights, weather, and stations data to minimize leakage. In contrast to our modeling objective of making predictions exclusively with data obtained two hours _before_ scheduled flight departure, initial EDA on the provided OTPW datset revealed weather station records obtained _at_ the scheduled departure time.\n",
    "\n",
    "To address this, we developed a multi-step pipeline to join the **7 years** of flights and weather data from 2015 to 2021 with several checkpoints, as outlined below:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We created a UDF to extract time zones based on each airport’s and station's latitude and longitude (parsed from the `coordinates` column in the airport codes stations table). The result was a 2 helper table:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    -  Airport time zones containing `icao_code`, `latitude`, `longitude`, and `timezone`, covering 2,237 unique airports.\n",
    "    -  Stations time zones table containing `STATION`, `LATITUDE`, `LONGITUDE`, and `timezone` , coveering 2,939 unique weather stations. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. We cleaned and deduplicated the flights data, retaining only necessary features. The dataset was reduced from a dimension of **74.18M x 109** to **42.43M x 29**.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. We joined the flights data with the airport codes table twice—once on the `ORIGIN` IATA code and once on the `DEST` IATA code—to obtain the corresponding `icao_code`, `type`, and `iso_region`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. We recalculated the distance between all weather stations and airports using the Haversine formula to get accurate proximity values in kilometers.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Before joining flights with stations, we identified seven missing `icao_code`s that were not present in the stations dataset. We augmented the stations data by computing distances for those airports using their coordinates from the airport codes table and saved the updated result for reuse.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. To improve join efficiency, we filtered the stations dataset down to only the closest station per airport. This reduced the station-airport combination dataset from ~5 million rows to just 2,236 rows, significantly reducing shuffle during the join.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. We joined the flights dataset with the filtered stations data to retrieve the `station_id`, `station_lat`, `station_lon`, `airport_lat`, `airport_lon`, and `station_distance` for both origin and destination.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. After ensuring there were no missing `icao_code`s in the time zone helper table, we enriched the flights data by joining it with time zone info using `icao_code`. This enabled us to convert the scheduled departure time into UTC (`sched_depart_utc`) and compute `two_hours_prior_depart_UTC` and `four_hours_prior_depart_UTC` using UDFs.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. The weather dataset was preprocessed by removig duplicates, filtering only USA locations, selecting relevant features, converting date and time to UTC, and filtering to only include station-date combinations that matched those in the flights dataset. This reduced the weather data from a dimension of **898.98M x 124** to **29.27M x 18**.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. Finally, we joined the flights data with weather data and matched on station ID and filtered for weather records where the UTC timestamp was between two and four hours before scheduled departure. (See the data description section for selected weather features.)\n",
    "\n",
    "The full join pipeline took approximately **4 and half hours** using **5–10 workers**, producing a final DataFrame of **42.43M x 78** and a Parquet file of ~6.24 GB for the 7 years dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "All location-specific columns were prefixed with `origin_`/ to clearly indicate their reference point.\n",
    "\n",
    "To validate the pipeline, we tested it first on a 3-month sample and one year datasets before scaling to 7 years. We ensured data quality and maintained full lineage tracking throughout. All joins had a **100% match rate**, except for the weather join, which had a **99.86% match rate** for origin as expected due to slight gaps in available weather records.\n",
    "\n",
    "This pipeline provides a robust and well-validated dataset that serves as the foundation for downstream feature engineering and modeling."

    "The most critical missing values in the weather data were location-based; without latitude or longitude information we could not match the observation to the nearest airport. To identify stations, we extracted the USAF and WBAN codes from the first and second halves of the given weather station ID and parsed the ICAO code from the text report column (\"REM\"). We then matched whichever attribute was available to the stations dataset to fill in identifying information to the weather data and filtered out stations not in the United States or its territories. Missing feature observations in the weather dataset could be derived from sensor malfunctions and were often compounded to result in several hours or days in a row of missing data, even despite prolific duplicates. Duplicates are defined as multiple reports emitted from the same station at the same time. Therefore, our deduplication rule was simply to keep the record with the least null values in the hourly-level columns (our columns of interest). The de-duplicated dataset with location identifiers was then used as the weather base for the join. \n",

    "To address missing values in the weather data used for modeling, we first parsed the remarks column which contains METAR reports to extract relevant values. In cases where the METAR reports contained insufficient information or were also missing, we prioritized spatially-based imputation. This decision was based on the fact that the weather data matched to each flight was already two hours stale, limiting the usefulness of interpolation over time. Airports were geohashed using the python-geohash package at a precision level of 2, which clusters airports into coarse regional buckets to enable spatially coherent imputation. A more granular precision level resulted in not enough airports per bucket, whereas the less granular level was too broad and would not adequately capture region-specific weather conditions. \n",

    "For each missing weather observation, we attempted to impute values by pulling the most recent non-null weather reports timestamped between 2–6 hours prior to the flight's scheduled departure from other airports within the same geohash bucket in an attempt to capture immediate recent weather status and events.\n",
    "\n",
    "In cases where multiple stations within the geohash region had valid reports in that time window, we selected the most recent single record rather than computing an average, to reduce computational complexity. In cases where all stations in a region were down—due to widespread outages or technical issues—we implemented a fallback strategy by computing an exponential moving average (EMA) over the last 8 non-null records prior to the missing timestamp. This parameter was tuned to sufficiently capture remaining nulls without being unnecessarily wide. We chose the EMA approach to balance responsiveness to recent trends with the need to smooth over noise. Importantly, this method does not introduce label leakage: because all weather data were sourced from a 2–4 hour window prior to each flight's scheduled departure, no future data relative to the prediction target was used."

    "#### Overview\n",
    "One of our primary engineering focuses was recency features, based on the hypothesis that operational status indicators from the preceding flight leg of an aircraft—such as whether the aircraft was delayed, cancelled, departed, or arrived—would be highly predictive of disruption outcomes for the aircraft at the current origin. This decision was further supported by initial exploratory data analysis (discussed further below): Spearman correlation coefficients between raw features and the target variable revealed limited signal in most static flight attributes, and distributional comparisons showed little meaningful variation. This aligns with domain intuition: disruptions in the aircraft’s prior leg are likely to propagate and impact on-time performance at the next origin, which is supported by the sucess in model performance using these engineered features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Among the recency-based features we created, we selected the following estimates (i.e., calculated only from information known at or before 2 hours before scheduled departure) for modeling:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Binary indicators capturing prior flight’s status:\n",
    "   - Whether it departed from its previous origin\n",
    "   - Whether it was delayed at its previous origin\n",
    "   - Whether it was cancelled at its previous origin\n",
    "   - Whether it arrived at the current origin\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Continuous timing features (in minutes):\n",
    "   - Departure delay at the previous origin\n",
    "   - Air time of the prior flight\n",
    "   - Turnaround time between the prior arrival and scheduled departure of the current flight\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "When incorporating aircraft tracking data, we focused on addressing two major concerns: data quality issues and leakage.\n",
    "\n",
    "_Data Quality_\n",
    "\n",
    "We defined a prior flight by three conditions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Consistent aircraft identified by tail number\n",
    "2. The aircraft's immediate previous destination matches the current origin\n",
    "3. The aircraft left its immediate previous origin less than 24 hours before the current flight's T-2 scheduled departure time\n",
    "\n",
    "Our first condition assumes that a flight's actual tail number, i.e. assigned aircraft, is known at the time of evaluation. The second condition is motivated by observed inconsistencies in aircraft flight routes. For example, in one day an aircraft arrives at airport A, yet the next record of the same aircraft shows it departing from airport B, with no flight record of its flight from A to B. This condition intends to enforce data integrity by ensuring a prior flight really is the flight that aircraft completed to arrive at the current origin. The third condition is also motivated by the possibility of missing flight records and upholding the integrity of the meaning of a prior flight. There exist records where a plane's prior flight to its current origin may be several days or even months in the past. We believe a \"prior flight\" that happened too far in the past does not affect current flight delay in the way we are are hoping to capture via these recency features. Furthermore, because we don't understand the context for these gaps we consider the possibility that true prior flight activity records are not present. \n",
    "\n",
    "These filters helped reduce the risk of incorporating misleading features derived from incomplete route chains and uphold the expected meaning of our engineered features.\n",
    "\n",
    "_Leakage_\n",
    "\n",
    "We only wanted to incorporate information that would be known at the threshold T-2 hours before the scheduled departure time. This influenced the variables considered in our calculations, based on whether the estimated or actual timestamp data would be available, and how much of the continuous time duration data would be available.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two core assumptions were made: Firstly, that all prior flights are scheduled more than 2 hours before a record's scheduled departure time. Secondly, that an airport would know at the time threshold whether the immediate prior flight of an aircraft was cancelled. This is because we do not know at what point a flight is declared cancelled.\n",

    "#### Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "We began by calculating a threshold timestamp: 26 hours prior to each flight’s scheduled departure. Using this, we generated lagged features over the aircraft tail number (i.e., unique aircraft identifier), including origin and destination airports, scheduled and actual departure times, delays, and arrival times.\n",
    "\n",
    "Contingent on meeting the prior flight information criteria, we created the following features\n",
    "\n",
    "_Cancellation_: \n",
    "- Indicator (boolean): A binary flag indicating whether the previous flight was cancelled. No restriction on timing was applied, as cancellations are often logged early and knowing about them before the prediction threshold (2 hours prior to departure) aligns with our use case.\n",
    "\n",
    "_Delays:_\n",
    "- Continuous variable (minutes): Estimated delay of the prior flight, computed based on available data:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - If the prior flight scheduled departure and recorded departure were both before the threshold, we  simply used the true recorded delay value.\n",
    "   - If the prior flight was scheduled to depart before the threshold, but did not have a recorded true departure time yet, we did not attempt to estimate what the further delay might be. Instead, we essentially made the assumption that it departed at the 2 hours prior UTC time by recording the delay as the difference between the threshold and the prior flight scheduled departure time. In the future, this could be fine tuned by setting a default parameter relative to the estimated prior flight time or estimated based on some other indicator, but it only accounted for a small proportion of cases and we did not want to introduce additional computational overhead.\n",
    "   - If the prior flight was scheduled to depart after the threshold, and the route information met the standard, we assumed there would be no delay, as we do not have cause to believe there might be. This could also be tuned by calculating average delay for that route, but as this only represented a small portion of cases, we similarly hesitated to introduce computationally intensive operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - If the prior flight was cancelled or the route information was missing, leaving us without data on the prior flight, we filled in the delay calculation with the most recent non-null delay data from the same route’s previous leg (i.e., the same origin-destination pair). Since we don't have the specific prior leg information, we instead look for the most recent available instance for the same route (same origin and destination) and use the delay from that prior flight as a proxy for the current flight’s delay. \n",
    "    \n",
    "       - This decision is based on the understanding that operational disruptions, including delays, are often correlated within the same route. Delays from one leg of a flight route are likely to impact subsequent flights on the same route. The rationale was further validated by EDA on the initial engineered features, which showed that when the prior flight's destination did not match the current flight's origin—an issue that occurred in 3% of the training dataset—58% of those cases led to disrupted outcomes (delays or cancellations). \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Indicator (boolean): If the prior flight was estimated to have been delayed, or known to have been cancelled, the delay indicator was set to True.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "_Departures_: \n",
    "\n",
    "- Indicator (boolean): If and only if the known prior flight departure time met the data quality standard and was before the threshold the boolean prior flight departure indicator was set to true. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Estimator (timestamp): The prior departure time was estimated by adding the estimated delay calculation to the scheduled departure time.\n",
    "\n",
    "_Arrivals_:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Indicator (boolean): If and only if the prior flight known arrival time met the data quality standard and was before the threshold, the indicator was set to True.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Estimator (timestamp):\n",
    "   - If the prior flight arrived before the 2-hour window, we filled this in with the true arrival time.\n",
    "   - If the prior flight was known to have departed before the threshold, we filled this in by adding the estimated elapsed time to the known departure time.\n",
    "   - Otherwise, we simply added the estimated elapsed time to the estimated departure time.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "_Turnaround time_: \n",
    "\n",
    "- To calculate the estimated amount of time the aircraft had between arriving and departing, we took the difference between the estimated arrival time of the previous flight and the estimated departure time of the current flight. If the previous flight was not confirmed, we again estimated this from the calculated turnaround time from the last record of this route being flown."

Delays also vary throughout the year as travel habits change--*e.g.* consider spring break, winter holidays, summer travel, or ski trips. We have engineered seasonality features to capture these effects quantitatively, in order to provide the model input about what seasonal effects may be at play for a given record.\n"

    "#### Methods\n",
    "To produce these features, we trained seasonality models using the Prophet Python library [5]. For a given training dataset (for each cross-validation fold and overall), a Prophet model was fit for each airport using the UTC departure time as the time field and departure delay in minutes as the outcome variable. Each model assumed linear growth, an uncertainty interval width of 90%, and included weekly, daily, yearly, and holiday (based on Prophet's US holiday lookup functionality) seasonality components. Each model was used to forecast predictions one week into the future, with an hourly frequency (*i.e.* to get the daily and weekly components for each hour throughout the week), and one year into the future with a daily frequency (*i.e.* to get the yearly and holiday components for each day of the year). These components, along with the airport identifier, were stored in lookup tables. The example below shows the seasonality components for Boston Logan International Airport (BOS), trained on the 2015-2018 training set.\n",

    "<div style=\"text-align: center; line-height: 6; padding-top: 30px;  padding-bottom: 30px;\">\n",

    "<div>\n",
    "\n",
    "To apply these seasonality components to the modeling data, the modeling data was joined to this lookup table. The daily and weekly components were joined on airport, day of week, and hour of day; and the yearly and holiday components were joined on airport, month, and day of month. The following table summarizes the resulting features.\n",
    "\n",
    "| Feature |  Data Type | Description |\n",
    "|:---:|:---:|:---:|\n",
    "| daily | Float | Daily seasonality component (offset from trend) in minutes |\n",
    "| weekly | Float | Weekly seasonality component (offset from trend) in minutes |\n",
    "| yearly | Float | Yearly seasonality component (offset from trend) in minutes |\n",
    "| holidays | Float | Holiday-related seasonality component (offset from trend) in minutes |\n",
    "\n",
    "Because these seasonality components are *trained* from data, we had to be mindful of leakage when creating these features. To ensure that our cross-validation and overall test sets were not contaminated with test data information, we trained a seaparate seasonality model for each cross-validation fold and the overall dataset, utilizing the relevant training dataset in each case (*e.g* the seasonality trained on CV fold 1 training data was applied to the CV fold 1 training and test sets). This does cause some leakage when the seasonality is applied to the same training set that it was trained on, but avoids leakage during evaluation on the test set.\n",
    "\n",
    "The below figure summarizes the Spearman correlation of the seasonality features with the outcome variable for the full 5 year (2015-2019) dataset.

In other words, the weather features are used for splits often, but don't usually result in large improvements in model performance.

The class 1 probability predictions were combined in an exponentially weighted average such that the most recent fold (fold 5) had the most weight, then thresholded to produce the final prediction. This approach yielded a final F2 test score of 0.5254. "

    "### Pipeline Review – Are We Leaking?\n",
    "\n",
    "We were very intentional about avoiding leakage when building our pipeline. For example:\n",
    "- We only used the scheduled departure time `CRS_DEP_TIME` instead of the actual departure time because we won't have access to the actual departure time in real time. \n",
    "- We aligned weather data to two hours before scheduled departure, never using data closer to the schduled departure or after takeoff.\n",
    "- We carefully joined based on location and time zones to ensure realistic data alignment.\n",
    "- We used the 2 hours before the scheduled departure time as a threshold to bring any other features.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, we did identify three key points of potential leakage:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Prior Flight Status Assumption**\n",
    "\n",
    "    We made the decision to assume the status of the previous flight (e.g., cancellation or delay) was known two hours before the current flight.\n",
    "\n",
    "      **Why it’s a problem:** In real-time, this may not always be true. The prior flight might still be en route or awaiting departure.\n",
    "\n",
    "      **Impact:** The model might be trained with more accurate context than would exist at prediction time.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **PageRank on the Full data**\n",
    "\n",
    "    We computed graph-based PageRank features using the entire flight network.\n",
    "    \n",
    "      **Why it’s a problem:** This approach allows “future” routes to influence the importance of nodes (airports) in the graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "      **Impact:** It gives the model indirect access to information from the future, which wouldn’t be available in real time.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Prophet Model Trained on the Full Year**\n",
    "\n",
    "    Our seasonality features were generated using Prophet fitted to the entire dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "      **Why it’s a problem:** It includes future seasonal trends (e.g., holiday surges) that wouldn’t be known in advance.\n",

    "\n",
    "Accurate prediction of flight delays enables airports to prepare for operational shocks, in order to prevent delay propagation. Our aim is to design a machine learning classificaiton model to predict whether a flight will be delayed, using historical flight and weather data. In this phase, we introduced engineered features for prior flight status and seasonality. Training logistic regression models on these features, plus numeric weather and flight metadata features from the raw data, we produced models that achieved F2 scores ranging from 0.27 to 0.57 on a held-out set. The models with engineered features outperformed those without them, which supports the predictive power of the engineered features. In the next phase, we plan to introduce additional engineered features capturing airport-level delay recency and frequency, the network structure of flights and airports, and long-term seasonality. We will also explore nonlinear models including XGBoost, Random Forest, and Multi-Layer Perceptron; and will train these models using a five-year dataset. We anticipate that these additions will allow us to produce a robust and performant model to suit our stakeholders' needs."
